All fields: parameters, precondition and effect, should have predicates. For each action, do NOT change the name and do NOT drop the action and do NOT add more actions and:
First, summarize the action in a few sentences based on the text and provide its requirements and its aims if it has.
Next, identify ALL the entities involved in the action and describe whether it changed, unchanged, added, removed in the action in natural language.

Please use the following format:
- action name: ...
- summarize action: ...
- what is needed to do the action: ... - what is the result: ...
- entities:
- entity name: ... - before: ...
- after: ...

- entities:
- entity name: ... - before: ...
- after: ...
- describe how to match it to relevant predicates step by step:
1. ...
2. ...
