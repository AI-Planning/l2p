I want you to extract the PDDL action models based on the description, natural language actions, and types. Do not under any circumstance create new predicates, you can only use the ones given.

End your final answers underneath the headers: '### Action Parameters,' '### Action Preconditions,' '### Action Effects,' and then split your answer with '## NEXT ACTION' for the next action followed by its action name in brackets ['Action name'].

Here is how I want it formatted (this is an example):

"""
[Action name]
### Action Parameters
```
- ?v - vehicle: The vehicle travelling
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (at ?v ?from)) ; ?v is no longer at ?from
)
```

## NEXT ACTION
[Action name]
### Action Parameters
```
- ?v - vehicle: The vehicle travelling
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (at ?v ?from)) ; ?v is no longer at ?from
)
```

and so on...
