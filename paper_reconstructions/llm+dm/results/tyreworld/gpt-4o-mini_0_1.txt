Action: Open a container
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (container-open ?c - container): true if the container ?c is open
- (object-in-container ?o - small_object ?c - container): true if the object ?o is located in the container ?c
- (robot-holding ?o - small_object): true if the robot is currently holding the object ?o
- (hub-on-ground ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h is on the ground and not jacked up
- (nut-loosened ?n - nut): true if the nut ?n has been loosened
- (hub-fastened ?h - hub): true if the hub ?h has been fastened with a nut
- (wheel-removed ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w has been removed from its hub
- (wheel-inflated ?w - wheel): true if the wheel ?w has been inflated
--------------------
--------------------
### Response
The error message indicates that the precondition for the action incorrectly specifies that the robot is holding a container instead of a small object. To correct this, I will modify the preconditions to ensure that the robot is holding a small object that is located in the container. Hereâ€™s the revised action:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?c - container: the container to open
- ?o - small_object: the small object that the robot is holding
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (not (container-open ?c))
    (robot-holding ?o)
    (object-in-container ?o ?c)
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (container-open ?c)
    (not (robot-holding ?o))
)
```

### New Predicates
```
``` 

This revision ensures that the robot is holding a small object that is inside the specified container, aligning with the available predicates and correcting the initial error.


####################
Action: Close a container
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (container-open ?c - container): true if the container ?c is open
- (object-in-container ?o - small_object ?c - container): true if the object ?o is located in the container ?c
- (robot-holding ?o - small_object): true if the robot is currently holding the object ?o
--------------------
--------------------
### Response
The error message indicates that the precondition incorrectly uses the keyword "exists," which is not allowed in this context. To resolve this, we need to rephrase the precondition to avoid using "exists" while ensuring that the robot is not holding any small object before closing the container. I will adjust the preconditions accordingly.

### Action Parameters
```
- ?c - container: the container to close
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (container-open ?c)
    (not (robot-holding ?o))
)

### Action Effects

Action: Jack down a hub

You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:- (container-open ?c - container): true if the container ?c is open
- (object-in-container ?o - small_object ?c - container): true if the object ?o is located in the container ?c

- (nut-loosened ?n - nut): true if the nut ?n has been loosened
--------------------
--------------------
### Response
The error message indicates that the precondition incorrectly specifies the `robot-holding` predicate with a `hub` instead of a `small_object`. To correct this, I will change the action to reflect that the robot must be holding a `small_object` instead. Additionally, I will adjust the effects to ensure that the robot is no longer holding the hub after the action is completed. 

Here is the corrected action:

### Action Parameters
```
- ?h - hub: the hub to jack down
- ?o - small_object: the small object the robot is holding
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (hub-on-ground ?h)
    (robot-holding ?o)
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
