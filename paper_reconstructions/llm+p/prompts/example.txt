An example planning problem is:
"""
You have 5 blocks. 
b2 is on top of b5. 
b5 is on top of b1. 
b1 is on top of b4. 
b3 is on top of b2. 
b4 is on the table. 
b3 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b4 should be on top of b3. 
"""

The problem PDDL file to this problem is:
"""
(define (problem BW-rand-5)
