Chain of Thought for constructing a PDDL action effect:

1. Reason through the implications/effects of the action being performed in natural language. Reason through the available predicates listed. If absolutely necessary, you may create new predicates.
2. Specify natural language effect and new predicates used in PDDL format
3. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding effect)
4. Re-iterate preconditions and new predicates line-by-line into string underneath '### Action Effects' and '### New Predicates' heading respectively. The strings should be enclosed by ``` [ex: EFFECT] ```.

The output should format and syntax like the following:

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
)
```

### New Predicates
```
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (a vehicle or a worker) is at the location ?l
```
