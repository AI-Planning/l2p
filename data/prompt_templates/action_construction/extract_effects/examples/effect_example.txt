The following is an in-context example following the CoT technique.

Given domain:
'The AI agent is here a scheduling system for a house construction company with administrators who can create orders, workers who perform them and vehicles to transport things.'

Given action: 
'drive'

Given action description:
'A vehicle drives from a location to another. Requires that the vehicle is at the starting location and that the two locations are connected. Example: truck1 drives from loc1 to house1.'

Given parameters:
```
?v - vehicle: The vehicle travelling
?from - location: The location travelling from
?to - location: The location travelling to
```

Given precondition
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
    (or (connected ?from ?to) (connected ?to ?from)) ; A road exists between the locations
)
```

## Available Predicates:
```
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (a vehicle or a worker) is at the location ?l
- (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): true if a road exists between ?l1 and ?l2 allowing vehicle travel between them.
``` 

-----------------------------------------------------

1. Reason through the implications/effects of the action being performed in natural language.
So, what happens when the action is performed?
 - The vehicle is no longer at ?from.
 - The vehicle is now at ?to.

This doesn't need any new predicates. 

2. Specify natural language effect and any new predicates introduced in PDDL format:
```
(and
    (not (at ?v ?from)) ; ?v is no longer at ?from
    (at ?v ?to) ; ?v is now instead at ?to
)
```

No new predicates were created. So no new predicates needed to add to list.

Feedback:
    1: Are any necessary effects forgotten?
        The effects don't model the fuel usage of the car. This should be done. So: Yes.

    2: Are any non-necessary effects included?
        The effects are correct. Therefore: No.

    3: Are the used predicates unclear or can be improved?
        With the exception of the symmetrical use of "connected", which is detailed below, it's clear. So: No.

    4: Should any predicate be used symmetrically and isn't?
        Since roads are undirected, we need to check if there is a road from ?from to ?to or vice versa. Not doing so creates brittle PDDL. As such: Yes.

Response: no response.

Re-iterate:

### Action Effects
These are the exact same as above, but they need to be reiterated:
```
(and
    (not (at ?v ?from)) ; ?v is no longer at ?from
    (at ?v ?to) ; ?v is now instead at ?to
)
```

### New Predicates
No new predicates created.
