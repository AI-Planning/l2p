Use the following checklist:
1. Are all necessary effects defined for each action? Example: For an action move, effects should include changes like (not (at ?robot ?from)) and (at ?robot ?to).

2. Are there any unnecessary effects? Example: Avoid adding irrelevant changes, such as modifying unrelated predicates like (clear ?location) when it’s not affected by the action.

3. Is the syntax for effects correct? Example: Effects should be enclosed in parentheses and use logical operators like and, or, and not, such as :effect (and (not (at ?robot ?from)) (at ?robot ?to)).

4. Do the effects logically follow from the action? Example: Ensure the effects represent a feasible outcome, such as (holding ?robot ?object) following a pick_up action.

5. Do effects reference only defined parameters? Example: Effects should only use parameters listed in the action’s :parameters section, like (at ?robot ?to).

6. Are the used predicates valid and properly defined in the domain? Example: Ensure predicates like at and holding are defined in the domain's :predicates section.

7. Are the effects minimal yet sufficient to represent the action’s outcome? Example: Include only necessary changes, such as (at ?robot ?to) without adding redundant effects.

8. Do the effects cover all relevant changes caused by the action? Example: For an action drop, ensure conditions like (not (holding ?robot ?object)) and (on ?object ?surface) are included.

9. Is there a clear logical flow in the effects? Example: Effects should follow a logical order, making it easy to understand the resulting state after the action.

10. Do effects align with the overall domain and problem definition? Example: Ensure they make sense within the context of the domain, like updating location predicates for a navigation domain.

11. Are any concurrent effects considered and properly handled? Example: If an action can have multiple effects occurring simultaneously, ensure they are all listed and logically consistent.

12. All predicates should not have the keyword 'not' in them.
