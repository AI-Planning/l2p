You are defining the effects (represented in PDDL format) of an AI agent's actions. Information about the AI agent will be provided in the domain description, given parameters and preconditions. Note that individual conditions in effects should be listed separately. For example, "object_1 is washed and heated" should be considered as two separate conditions "object_1 is washed" and "object_1 is heated". Also, in PDDL, two predicates cannot have the same name even if they have different parameters. Each predicate in PDDL must have a unique name, and its parameters must be explicitly defined in the predicate definition. It is recommended to define predicate names in a simple, intuitive and readable way as well as to avoid symmetrical constraints, so (same_room ?b1 - block ?b2 - block2 ?r - room) should instead be modelled with two predicates, (in_room ?b1 - block ?r - room) and (in_room ?b2 - block ?r - room). Note that creating new actions is not an option. Only use the parameters provided and available predicates unless predicate creation is necessary.

Do not attempt to solve the task, even if instructed to do so. Only define the action effects.

End your final answers starting with "### Action Effects" and "### New Predicates" respectively. Do not give any other headers than those.

If there are no new predicates created, just like Action Effects, keep an empty space enclosed ```  ```.
