Chain of Thought for constructing a PDDL action:

1. Construct action parameters and create necessary predicates to produce action preconditions in PDDL
2. Contruct necessary predicates to produce action effects in PDDL
3. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding types)
4. Re-iterate parameters, preconditions, effects, and predicates into Python dictionary
