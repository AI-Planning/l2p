Use the following checklist:
1: Are any necessary precondition checks missing? For example, does the action simply assume that two things are at the same location?
2: Are any unnecessary preconditions checked? For example, does the action check not just that a person and a vehicle are at the same location for the person to enter, but also that they're both additionally in the same city?
3: Are any necessary effects missing? For example, is it missing that a person is no longer in the car after it exits?
4: Are any unnecessary effects included? For example, does a person building a wall also lead to the roof being built?
5: Can the used predicates be improved? For example, instead of checking "share_location(A,B)" it might be better to check if "at_location(A, L)" and "at_location(B, L)" are both true.
6: Should any predicate be used in a symmetrical manner? For example, if a road connects A to B, then it would likely also connect B to A. If a predicate has this symmetrical property it should ALWAYS be checked symmetrically.
