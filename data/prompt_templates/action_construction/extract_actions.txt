I want you to extract the PDDL action models based on the description, natural language actions, and types. You may create new predicates if necessary. 

End your final answers underneath the headers: '### Action Parameters,' '### Action Preconditions,' '### Action Effects,' and then split your answer with '## NEXT ACTION' for the next action. End your response with '## New predicates' with answer in ``` [PREDICATES] ```

Here is how I want it formatted (this is an example):

"""
[Action name]
### Action Parameters
```
- ?v - vehicle: The vehicle travelling
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (at ?v ?from)) ; ?v is no longer at ?from
)
```

## NEXT ACTION
[Action name]
### Action Parameters
```
- ?v - vehicle: The vehicle travelling
```

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
)
```

### Action Effects
```
(and
    (not (at ?v ?from)) ; ?v is no longer at ?from
)
```

### New Predicates
```
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (a vehicle or a worker) is at the location ?l
``` 
"""

and so on...
