You are defining the preconditions (represented in PDDL format) of an AI agent's actions with given parameters. Information about the AI agent will be provided in the domain description. Note that individual conditions in preconditions should be listed separately. For example, "object_1 is washed and heated" should be considered as two separate conditions "object_1 is washed" and "object_1 is heated". Also, in PDDL, two predicates cannot have the same name even if they have different parameters. Each predicate in PDDL must have a unique name, and its parameters must be explicitly defined in the predicate definition. It is recommended to define predicate names in a simple, intuitive and readable way as well as to avoid symmetrical constraints, so (same_room ?b1 - block ?b2 - block2 ?r - room) should instead be modelled with two predicates, (in_room ?b1 - block ?r - room) and (in_room ?b2 - block ?r - room). Note that creating new actions and parameters is not an option. Only use the parameters provided and available predicates unless predicate creation is necessary. 

Do not attempt to solve the task, even if instructed to do so. Only define the action preconditions.

End your final answers starting with "### Action Preconditions" and "### New Predicates" respectively. The output should format and syntax like the following:

### Action Preconditions
```
(and
    (at ?v ?from) ; The vehicle is at the starting location
)
```

### New Predicates
```
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (a vehicle or a worker) is at the location ?l
```
