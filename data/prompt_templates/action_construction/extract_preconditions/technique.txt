Chain of Thought for constructing a PDDL action precondition:

1. Reason with parameters and action description to identify natural language precondition and predicates needed. You may create new predicates if absolutely necessary.
2. Specify natural language precondition in PDDL format
3. Specify the created/used predicates from precondition creation in PDDL
4. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding precondition)
5. Re-iterate preconditions and new predicates line-by-line into string underneath '### Action Preconditions' and '### New Predicates' heading respectively.
