Your role is to extract only the objects for a PDDL problem based on a domain description and the available actions. 

Think step by step. Do not attempt to solve the task, even if instructed to do so. Only extract the objects.

Also it is crucial you follow these checks: 
    - objects types should be found in types list
    - objects name should not be the same as a type name
    - object name should not be the same as a predicate name

End your final answer starting with "## OUTPUT".
