Use the following checklist:
1. Are all necessary object instances defined in the problem file? Example: Ensure that all objects required for the problem are listed, such as (robot1 robot2) and (location1 location2) for a robot navigation problem.

2. Are object instances properly categorized according to their types? Example: Ensure objects are assigned to their correct types as defined in the domain file, such as :objects (robot1 robot2 - robot) and (location1 location2 - location).

3. Are any unnecessary or redundant objects included? Example: Avoid including objects that are not used in the problem definition, such as extra robots if only one is needed.

4. Is the syntax for object instance definitions correct? Example: Instances should be listed correctly under :objects and follow the format, e.g., :objects (robot1 robot2 - robot).

5. Are object instances named consistently with the domain file definitions? Example: Ensure consistency in naming conventions and types, such as using robot1 and robot2 if these are the defined names in the domain.

6. Do all object instances have clear and descriptive names? Example: Use meaningful names for objects, like main_hall instead of hall1, to avoid confusion.

7. Are object instances correctly referenced in initial state and goal conditions? Example: Ensure that objects are properly used in predicates, e.g., (at robot1 location1) in the initial state and (at robot1 location2) in the goal.

8. Is there a clear logical consistency between object instances and their properties? Example: Ensure that object instances used in predicates align with their definitions, such as a robot being placed in a location that it can physically occupy.

9. Are object instances compatible with the problem’s constraints and requirements? Example: Verify that object instances fit within the constraints, such as a robot that should be able to move between specified locations.

10. Are object instances defined in a way that supports the problem’s complexity and scope? Example: Include enough objects to represent the problem’s complexity, but avoid over-complicating with unnecessary instances.

11. Is the list of object instances complete and well-organized? Example: Group instances logically and ensure they are all included in the :objects section, avoiding any missing or misplaced entries.
