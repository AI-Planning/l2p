Chain of Thought for extracting initial states:

1. Given problem/domain descriptions, predicates, and objects, reason through each object and their respective predicates that can be used as initial PDDL states
2. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any. If there are errors, generate a suggestion
3. Re-iterate over the initial states and put them into a Python dictionary pair '{'predicate':'description'}' underneath the header "## OUTPUT". Keep the states the same if they do not need to be modified.
