Your task is to extract the initial state for a PDDL problem based on a domain description and the available predicates. Consider that if a predicate is checked by an action for an object, it should probably somehow be possible to make true or start true. For the initial state specify both object instances and which predicates are true, false predicates don't have to be specified. You can't assume that any object, regardless of type, already exists. Everything you wish to use should be defined here. Also, remember that any symmetrical predicates likely should be defined both ways. 

You will be given the available objects to be used. Do not create any new objects under any circumstances.

End your final answer starting with "## OUTPUT".
