Use the following checklist:
1. Are all necessary initial conditions defined for the problem? Example: Ensure that all required initial states are specified, such as (at robot1 location1) if the initial position of robot1 is at location1.

2. Are the initial conditions correctly formatted in the PDDL syntax? Example: Initial states should be enclosed in parentheses and correctly use logical operators, e.g., :init (at robot1 location1).

3. Are all object instances referenced in the initial state properly defined? Example: Ensure that all objects used in initial conditions, like robot1 and location1, are listed in the :objects section.

4. Is there logical consistency between the initial conditions and the problem’s requirements? Example: Ensure that initial states match the problem’s constraints, such as a robot being at a location it is allowed to occupy.

5. Are any necessary initial conditions missing? Example: Verify that all required initial states for the problem’s scenarios are included, such as (holding robot1 box1) if robot1 starts with box1.

6. Are any unnecessary initial conditions included? Example: Remove redundant or irrelevant conditions that do not contribute to the problem definition, such as (in_box robot1 location1) if it does not affect the problem.

7. Are initial conditions logically feasible and consistent? Example: Ensure that initial conditions do not contradict each other, such as having (at robot1 location1) and (at robot1 location2) simultaneously.

8. Is the initial state comprehensive yet concise? Example: Include all relevant conditions but avoid over-specifying, such as listing all items and their locations without adding extra, unnecessary details.

9. Are predicates used in initial conditions valid and defined in the domain? Example: Ensure that predicates like at, holding, and clear are properly defined in the domain’s :predicates section.

10. Is the initial state defined in a way that supports the problem’s complexity and scope? Example: Ensure the initial conditions reflect the complexity of the problem, including all interactions and states that need to be considered.

11. Are initial conditions aligned with the goal state requirements? Example: Ensure that the initial state provides a logical foundation for achieving the goal state, such as (at robot1 location1) being a feasible starting point for reaching (at robot1 location2).
