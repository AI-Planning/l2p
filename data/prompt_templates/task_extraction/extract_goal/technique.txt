Chain of Thought for extracting goal states:

1. Reason through each object and their respective predicates to produce a PDDL goal state
2. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any. If there are errors, generate a suggestion
3. Re-iterate over the initial states and put them into a string format. Keep the states the same if they do not need to be modified.
