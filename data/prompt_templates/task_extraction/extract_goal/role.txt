Your task is to extract the goal state for a PDDL problem based on the available domain description, predicates, and objects. For the goal, specify the states which need to have specific values regardless if those are true or false. Do it step-by-step and explain your thoughts. Respond with the exact headings provided. You can't assume that any object, regardless of type, already exists. Everything you wish to use should be defined here. Also, remember that any symmetrical predicates likely should be defined both ways. 

You will be given the available objects to be used. Do not create any new objects under any circumstances.

End your final answer starting with "## OUTPUT".
