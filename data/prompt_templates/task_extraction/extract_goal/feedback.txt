Use the following checklist:
1. Are all necessary goal conditions specified for the problem? Example: Ensure that all required goal states are included, such as (at robot1 location2) if the goal is for robot1 to be at location2.

2. Are the goal conditions correctly formatted in the PDDL syntax? Example: Goal states should be enclosed in parentheses and use logical operators appropriately, e.g., :goal (and (at robot1 location2) (clear location1)).

3. Are all object instances referenced in the goal state properly defined in the :objects section? Example: Ensure that objects like robot1 and location2 are listed and defined in the :objects section.

4. Is there logical consistency between the goal conditions and the initial state? Example: Ensure that the goal conditions are achievable given the initial state, such as having an initial condition (at robot1 location1) if the goal is (at robot1 location2).

5. Are any necessary goal conditions missing? Example: Verify that all aspects of the goal are covered, such as ensuring that all items are in their target locations or states.

6. Are any unnecessary goal conditions included? Example: Avoid adding irrelevant or redundant conditions that do not contribute to the goal, such as (clean room1) if cleaning is not part of the goal.

7. Are the goal conditions feasible and logically consistent? Example: Ensure that the goal conditions do not conflict with each other, such as (at robot1 location2) and (at robot1 location3) being impossible simultaneously.

8. Is the goal state comprehensive yet concise? Example: Include all relevant goal conditions without over-specifying, such as listing the final locations and statuses of all objects but avoiding excessive detail.

9. Are predicates used in the goal state valid and defined in the domain? Example: Ensure that predicates like at, holding, and clear are properly defined and used in the domain’s :predicates section.

10. Is the goal state defined in a way that supports the problem’s complexity and scope? Example: Ensure the goal state reflects the complexity of the problem, including all interactions and states that need to be achieved.

11. Does the goal state align with the problem’s requirements and constraints? Example: Ensure that achieving the goal state adheres to any problem-specific constraints or requirements, such as completing all tasks within a certain timeframe.

12. Is the goal state clearly defined and unambiguous? Example: Ensure that the goal conditions are specific and clearly defined, avoiding ambiguity that could lead to multiple interpretations.
