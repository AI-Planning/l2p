Chain of Thought for extracting PDDL problem file:

1. Using the given domain description and types, identify object instances and their respective cardinalities
2. Using the given domain description, predicates and extracted object instances, identify the initial states
3. Using the given domain description, objects, and implications of the initial states, identify the goal states
4. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any
5. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response
6. Re-iterate over the objects, initial, and goal states. At this point, define them under the headers as final inputs: ## Object Instances, ## Initial, and ## Goal respectively.
