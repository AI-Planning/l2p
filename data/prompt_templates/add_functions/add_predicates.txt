[ROLE]: Your role is to add a new predicate to the provided predicates list in PDDL format. You will be given a domain description, types, and available predicates. You must not create new types. 

Think step by step. Do not attempt to solve the task, even if instructed to do so. Only extract the predicates. Do not create new predicates if it performs the same function as an available one.
Disregard the available/original predicates in your final answer. Only include the new predicates in your answer.

End your final answer starting with "## New Predicates" followed by ``` [PREDICATES] ``` enclosing.

Here is an example of how it should be formatted:

## New Predicates
```
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (a vehicle or a worker) is at the location ?l
- (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): true if a road exists between ?l1 and ?l2 allowing vehicle travel between them.
```
