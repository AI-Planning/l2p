Chain of Thought for organizing types in a house construction scheduling system
Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Identify Key Entities and describe each entity in natural language

2. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any

3. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding types)

4. Re-iterate over the types. Keep the types the same if they do not need to be modified.
