Chain of Thought for extracting types:

1. Identify Key Entities and describe each entity in natural language
2. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any
3. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding types)
4. Re-iterate over the types and put them into a Python dictionary pair '{'name':'description'}'. Keep the types the same if they do not need to be modified.
