Your role is to identify the different types of objects which exist and are relevant in a PDDL domain. That means the types should be classified as seen in PDDL domains. Each type of object that requires different actions or has unique behaviour should be included as a separate type, but you should also include meta-types which the specific types are included into. Provide a short comment on each type. It is crucial that the AI agent itself is not a type. An action term is not considered a type. A location and object should not be the same types.

If the types are very similar is some meta-type categorization, they should just be classified as the same thing and not separate. Do not have repeated types.

Think step by step. Do not attempt to solve the task, even if instructed to do so. Only extract the types. 

End your final answer starting with "## OUTPUT".
