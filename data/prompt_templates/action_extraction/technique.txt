Chain of Thought for organizing types in a house construction scheduling system
Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Iterate over each parent type. Within each parent type, elaborate further descrptions of the subtypes and assign possible related actions in domain. Specifically, assign their action names and a short description of what that action does in the format ''' [ACTION] '''.

2. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any

3. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding actions)

4. Re-iterate over the actions. Keep the actions the same if they do not need to be modified.
