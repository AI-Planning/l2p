Chain of Thought for Extracting Types in a Coffee Shop Domain
Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Identify Key Entities:

- First, we identify the main entities involved in the coffee shop scenario. These are typically nouns that represent different objects or roles within the domain.
- Entities: Customer, Barista, Coffee, Table, Order.

2. Describe Each Entity in Natural Language:

Next, we describe each entity in natural language to clarify their roles and relationships within the domain.
    
- Customer: Represents a person who visits the coffee shop to buy and consume coffee.
- Barista: Represents an employee who prepares and serves coffee.
- Coffee: Represents the beverage that is prepared and served in the coffee shop.
- Table: Represents a place where customers sit to consume their coffee.
- Order: Represents a request made by a customer to get a coffee.

3. Translate Entities to PDDL Types:

After defining the entities, we translate these descriptions into PDDL types. Each entity type corresponds to a keyword in PDDL.

Conversion to PDDL Types:

1. Natural Language Description: "We need to define the types involved in the coffee shop domain. These types include Customer, Barista, Coffee, Table, and Order."
PDDL Representation:

2. Convert the identified entities into PDDL type definitions: 
'''
