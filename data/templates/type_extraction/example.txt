Chain of Thought for Extracting Types in a Coffee Shop Domain
Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Identify Key Entities

2. Describe Each Entity in Natural Language

3. Parse described types into dictionary

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. We need to define the types involved in the coffee shop domain. These types include Customer, Barista, Coffee, Table, and Order.
- First, we identify the main entities involved in the coffee shop scenario. These are typically nouns that represent different objects or roles within the domain.
- Entities: Customer, Barista, Coffee, Table, Order.

2. Next, we describe each entity in natural language to clarify their roles and relationships within the domain.

- Customer: Represents a person who visits the coffee shop to buy and consume coffee.
- Barista: Represents an employee who prepares and serves coffee.
- Coffee: Represents the beverage that is prepared and served in the coffee shop.
- Table: Represents a place where customers sit to consume their coffee.
- Order: Represents a request made by a customer to get a coffee.

3. We now parse the types into Python dictionary as follows:

{'customer': 'Represents a person who visits the coffee shop', 'barista': 'Represents an employee who prepares and serves coffee', 'coffee': 'Represents the beverage served in the coffee shop', 'table': 'Represents a place where customers sit', 'order': 'Represents a request made by a customer for coffee'}
