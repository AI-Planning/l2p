Chain of Thought for organizing types in a house construction scheduling system
Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Given a further description of each of the listed types given based off the domain description

2. Compare the relationships of each type descriptions with the rest of the types in the list dictionary. If they are tightly close (i.e. belong in same category), but are not sub classes of each other, add them to their parent class. If there are no meta-type class for those relationships, create one.

3. Assemble a hierarchy with the formed relationships in the previous step

4. Parse the hierarchy types into a Python nested dictionary structure

## Domain
The AI agent is here a scheduling system for a house construction company with administrators who can create orders, workers who perform them and vehicles to transport things.

1. Types
The types are:
- administrator: Workers who can create orders for other workers
- wall: The exterior of a house. Requires a floor to be built first
- order: Instructions to general_workers to perform something. Created by administrators
- general_worker: Workers who can perform a variety of tasks, if there is an order for it
- vehicle: Used to transport equipment
- house: What is constructed. Can be finalised when all components are built
- house_component: The parts which make up houses
- floor: The bottom of a house. Can be built wherever
- depot: Where material is stored and vehicles can be loaded
- roof: The top of a house. Requires the walls to be built first
- location: Places where workers and machines can be
- mansion: A large type of house
- library: A building filled with books

2. Reasoning
The "administrator" and "general_worker" are both types of human workers, so we should probably create a "worker" meta-type class for those.

Furthermore, there are several different types of "house_component": "floor", "roof", and "wall". However, these aren't a subtype of "house" since a "floor" is not a "house" for example.

On the other hand, there are actually two subtypes of "house": "mansion" and "library". Both of these are types of houses.

Additionally, "house" and "depot" are both types of locations which can be visited. So, they're subtypes of "location".

"vehicle" is not a subtype or meta-type to any of the others. Same thing holds for "order". 

3. Hierarchy
So, all in all the hierarchy becomes:

- object: Object is always root, everything is an object
    - worker: A type of object consisting of humans who do things.
        - administrator: A type of worker.
        - general_worker: A type of worker.
    - order: A type of object consisting of instructions.
    - vehicle: A type of object consisting of vehicles.
    - house_component: A type of object consisting of the components of a house.
        - wall: A type of house_component.
        - floor: A type of house_component.
        - roof: A type of house_component.
    - location: A type of object consisting of places which can be visited.
        - house: A type of location. 
            - mansion: A type of house.
            - library: A type of house.
    - depot: A type of location.

4. Parsing:

{
    "name": "object",
    "children": [
        {
            "name": "worker",
            "children": [
                {"name": "administrator", "children": []},
                {"name": "general_worker", "children": []}
            ]
        },
        {"name": "order", "children": []},
        {"name": "vehicle", "children": []},
        {
            "name": "house_component",
            "children": [
                {"name": "wall", "children": []},
                {"name": "floor", "children": []},
                {"name": "roof", "children": []}
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "location",
            "children": [
                {
                    "name": "house",
                    "children": [
                        {"name": "mansion", "children": []},
                        {"name": "library", "children": []}
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {"name": "depot", "children": []}
    ]
}
