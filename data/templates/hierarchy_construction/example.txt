Chain of Thought for organizing types in a house construction scheduling system
Step-by-Step Reasoning:

## Domain
The AI agent is here a scheduling system for a house construction company with administrators who can create orders, workers who perform them and vehicles to transport things.

## Types
The types are:
- administrator: Workers who can create orders for other workers
- wall: The exterior of a house. Requires a floor to be built first
- order: Instructions to general_workers to perform something. Created by administrators
- general_worker: Workers who can perform a variety of tasks, if there is an order for it
- vehicle: Used to transport equipment
- house: What is constructed. Can be finalised when all components are built
- house_component: The parts which make up houses
- floor: The bottom of a house. Can be built wherever
- depot: Where material is stored and vehicles can be loaded
- roof: The top of a house. Requires the walls to be built first
- location: Places where workers and machines can be
- mansion: A large type of house
- library: A building filled with books

## Reasoning
The "administrator" and "general_worker" are both types of human workers, so we should probably create a "worker" meta-type class for those.

Furthermore, there are several different types of "house_component": "floor", "roof", and "wall". However, these aren't a subtype of "house" since a "floor" is not a "house" for example.

On the other hand, there are actually two subtypes of "house": "mansion" and "library". Both of these are types of houses.

Additionally, "house" and "depot" are both types of locations which can be visited. So, they're subtypes of "location".

"vehicle" is not a subtype or meta-type to any of the others. Same thing holds for "order". 

## Hierarchy
So, all in all the hierarchy becomes:
```
- object: Object is always root, everything is an object
    - worker: A type of object consisting of humans who do things.
        - administrator: A type of worker.
        - general_worker: A type of worker.
    - order: A type of object consisting of instructions.
    - vehicle: A type of object consisting of vehicles.
    - house_component: A type of object consisting of the components of a house.
        - wall: A type of house_component.
        - floor: A type of house_component.
        - roof: A type of house_component.
    - location: A type of object consisting of places which can be visited.
        - house: A type of location. 
            - mansion: A type of house.
            - library: A type of house.
    - depot: A type of location.
