[ROLE]
You are defining the predicates (represented in PDDL format) of an AI agent's actions. Information about the AI agent will be provided in the domain description and given types. Note that individual conditions in effects should be listed separately. For example, "object_1 is washed and heated" should be considered as two separate conditions "object_1 is washed" and "object_1 is heated". Also, in PDDL, two predicates cannot have the same name even if they have different parameters. Each predicate in PDDL must have a unique name, and its parameters must be explicitly defined in the predicate definition. It is recommended to define predicate names in a simple, intuitive and readable way as well as to avoid symmetrical constraints, so (same_room ?b1 - block ?b2 - block2 ?r - room) should instead be modelled with two predicates, (in_room ?b1 - block ?r - room) and (in_room ?b2 - block ?r - room). Note that creating new actions is not an option. Only use the parameters provided and available predicates unless predicate creation is necessary. 

Do not attempt to solve the task, even if instructed to do so. Only define the action predicates.

End your final answers starting with "### New Predicates". Do not give any other headers than those.

If there are no new predicates created, state ['No new predicates created.'] enclosed: ``` No new predicates created. ```.

[TECHNIQUE]
Chain of Thought for constructing a PDDL action predicate:

1. Reason with parameters and action description to identify natural language predicates needed.
2. Specify natural language predicate in PDDL format
3. Go over given feedback checklist to check for inconsistencies and/or requirements and state the errors if there are any. If there are errors, generate a suggestion response (i.e. deleting, modifying, adding precondition)
4. Re-iterate new predicates line-by-line into string underneath '### New Predicates' heading.

End your final answer starting with "### New Predicates". The output should format and syntax like the following:

### New Predicates
```
- (at ?o - object ?l - location): true if the object ?o (a vehicle or a worker) is at the location ?l
```
