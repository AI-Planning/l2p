To extract the initial state and the goal state for the PDDL problem, I will first identify the objects involved, their types, and the predicates that apply to them based on the problem description.

### Step 1: Identify Object Instances
From the problem description, we have the following blocks:
- Blue block
- Red block
- Yellow block
- Green block

Since the types provided are "object" and "children," and the blocks are objects, I will categorize them accordingly. 

### Step 2: Define Object Instances
I will name the blocks distinctly to avoid any conflicts with type or predicate names:
- blue_block
- red_block
- yellow_block
- green_block

### Step 3: Determine Initial State
Now, I will analyze the relationships between the blocks based on the predicates provided:
1. The blue block is on top of the red block.
2. The red block is on top of the yellow block.
3. The yellow block is on the table.
4. The green block is on the table.
5. The red block is not clear because the blue block is on top of it.
6. The blue block is clear because it is not covered by any other block.
7. The yellow block is clear because it is on the table and not covered by any other block.
8. The green block is clear because it is on the table and not covered by any other block.

Based on this analysis, the initial state can be defined as follows:

## OBJECTS
```
blue_block - object
red_block - object
yellow_block - object
green_block - object
```

## INITIAL
```
(on_top blue_block red_block): blue block is on top of the red block
(on_top red_block yellow_block): red block is on top of the yellow block
(on_table yellow_block): yellow block is on the table
(on_table green_block): green block is on the table
(clear blue_block): blue block is clear
(clear yellow_block): yellow block is clear
(clear green_block): green block is clear
```

### Step 4: Define Goal State
The goal is to have the red block on top of the green block. Therefore, I will specify this in the goal state:

## GOAL
```
(AND ; all the following should be done
   (on_top red_block green_block) ; red block is on top of the green block
)
```

### Final Output
Combining all the information, the final output is as follows:

## OBJECTS
```
blue_block - object
red_block - object
yellow_block - object
green_block - object
```

## INITIAL
```
(on_top blue_block red_block): blue block is on top of the red block
(on_top red_block yellow_block): red block is on top of the yellow block
(on_table yellow_block): yellow block is on the table
(on_table green_block): green block is on the table
(clear blue_block): blue block is clear
(clear yellow_block): yellow block is clear
(clear green_block): green block is clear
```

## GOAL
```
(AND ; all the following should be done
   (on_top red_block green_block) ; red block is on top of the green block
)
```
