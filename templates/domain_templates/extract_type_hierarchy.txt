Organize a dependency tree for the class hierarchy between different objects within a PDDL domain. Do not expand on your reasoning, except as short comments. Each object should appear only once, even if it could belong to several types.  Note, that every child should be a subtype of its parent, not physically contained within the parent. You shouldn't create any new types except those needed for organisation of the provided types.

End your final answer starting with "## OUTPUT" and then the Python dictionary pair '{'name':'description'}' as so:

## OUTPUT
{
    "parent_type_1": "description",
    "children": [
        {
            "child_type_1": "description",
            "children": [
                {"child_child_type_1": "description", "children": []},
                {"child_child_type_2": "description", "children": []}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
