End your final answer starting with headers (in order) "### OBJECTS" (with no brackets) "### INITIAL" and "### GOAL" containg respective content with ''' ''' comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### OBJECTS
```
object1 - type_1
object2 - type_2
object3 - type_1
```

### INITIAL
```
(predicate_name object1 object2) ; comment for initial state predicate 1
(predicate_name object3 object4) ; comment for initial state predicate 2
(predicate_name object5) ; comment for initial state predicate 3
```

### GOAL
```
(and
   (predicate_name object) ; comment
)
```

Even if there is one goal state, it must contain the PDDL 'and' syntax. Each object must be declared separately with their type and not grouped - even if objects share the same type.
