End your final answer starting with "### INITIAL" containg the predicates with ''' ''' comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### INITIAL
```
(predicate_name object1 object2) ; comment for initial state predicate 1
(predicate_name object3 object4) ; comment for initial state predicate 2
(predicate_name object5) ; comment for initial state predicate 3
```
