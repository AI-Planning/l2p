End your final answer starting with "### GOAL" containg the predicates with ''' ''' comment blocks in PDDL as so:

### GOAL
```
(<predicate_name> <object1> <object2>) ; comment for goal state predicate 1
(<predicate_name> <object3> <object4>) ; comment for goal state predicate 2
(<predicate_name> <object5>) ; comment for goal state predicate 3
```
